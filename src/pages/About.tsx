                Hi! My name is Conall and I'm a 2nd Year Computer Science student studying at Queens' College, University of Cambridge.<br/>
                I'm interested in a wide range of topics throughout Computer Science, always eager to learn more about different areas. <br/>
                The languages I most enjoy using are Java and Python, as well as OCaml. I am also learning Javascript and TypeScript, but intend to continue
                learning many more languages with different (paradigms?).
            </p>

            Outside of Computer Science, I am currently the elected Undergraduate Accommodation & Facilities Officer for the JCR at Queens' College - 
            this involves working with the College to help organise accommodation for the 500+ Undergraduates at Queens', as well as to represent 
            the student body at weekly meetings with an Administrative Board of College. <br/>
            Additionally, while at Sixth Form, I used to lead the school's code club, focussed on teaching a group of Year 7 students the basics of programming.

            I also used to be a Young Leader at my local scout group for about 4 years, helping plan and lead activities for young scouts, having been a member of
            the Scout Association for over 10 years. <br/>
            In my free time, I enjoy listening to music and reading book - especially fantasy and science fiction genres. <br/>
            Before University, I played a variety of sports including Judo, tennis, and badminton. Since joining university, I have really enjoyed trying some new 
            and different sports like climbing and frisbee.
