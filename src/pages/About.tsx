            Hi! My name is Conall and I'm a 2nd Year Computer Science student studying at Queens' College, University of Cambridge. <br/>
            I'm interested in a wide range of topics within Computer Science, always eager to learn more about different areas. <br/>
            The languages I most enjoy using are Java and Python, as well as OCaml. I am also learning Javascript and TypeScript, 
            but intend to continue learning many more languages with different (paradigms?).

        I am currently the elected Undergraduate Accommodation & Facilities Officer for the JCR (Undergraduate Student Representatives) at Queens' College -
        this involves working with the College to help organise accommodation for the 500+ Undergraduates at Queens', 
        as well as to represent the student body at weekly meetings with an Administrative Board of College. <br/>
        Additionally, while at Sixth Form, I led the school's code club, focussing on teaching a group of Year 7 students 
        the basics of programming using a graphics package in Python. I also have a great interest in maths, 
        leading me to compete nationally in maths challenges, both as part of a team and solo.

        I was a Young Leader at my local scout group for 4 years, helping plan and lead activities for young scouts, 
        having been a member of the Scout Association for over 10 years.<br/>
         In my free time, I enjoy listening to music and reading book - especially fantasy and science fiction genres. <br/>
         Before University, I played a variety of sports including Judo, tennis, and badminton. Since joining university, 
         I have really enjoyed trying some new and different sports like climbing and Ultimate Frisbee.
