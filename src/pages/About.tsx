    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <p> 
        Hi! My name is Conall and I'm a 2nd Year Computer Science student studying at Queens' College, University of Cambridge.<br/>
        I'm interested in a wide range of topics throughout Computer Science, always eager to learn more about different areas.
    </p><p>
        Outside of Computer Science, I am currently the elected Undergraduate Accommodation & Facilities Officer for the JCR at Queens' College - 
        this involves working with the College to help organise accommodation for the 500+ Undergraduates at Queens', as well as to represent 
        the student body at weekly meetings with an Administrative Board of College.
    </p><p>
        Additionally, while at Sixth Form, I used to lead the school's code club, focussed on teaching a group of Year 7 students the basics of programming.<br/>
        I also used to be a Younger Leader at my local scout group, helping plan and lead activities for young scouts.
    </p>
