# mywebsite
Repo for my personal website
Link: https://conallmoss.github.io/

Built using Typescript, HTML and CSS with React, hosted on Github Pages.

I made this website with the primary purpose of learning the technologies used behind website creation, so that I could learn and understand these skills.

My website includes information about me, as well as a brief description of some of my projects/experience.

When building this website, I first followed the tutorial by WebDevSimplified [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lATafp15HWA), which gave me a basic template from which I could add my own content.
